# Plotly_Biodiversity

## Overview of the Analysis
  1.  Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
  2.  Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
  3.  Parse data in JSON format.
  4.  Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
  5.  Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.
  6.  Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
 
## Purpose

   Create a panel for demographic information and visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
